## Usage
In general, a plugin has public function that called `Configure` as entry point.
It receive Gowok project object as parameter, then continue to the factory.
After that, plugin is ready to use.

Overview of `Configure` function:
```go
func Configure(project *gowok.Project)
```
Example:
```go
plugin1.Configure(gowok.Get())
plugin2.Configure(gowok.Get())
plugin3.Configure(gowok.Get())
```
Or, inside Gowok `Configures` function:
```go
gowok.Get().Configures(
  plugin1.Configure,
  plugin2.Configure,
  plugin3.Configure,
)
```

After the `Configure` function called, other things are managed by plugin.
Each plugin has different behaviour based on how it will be used.
Reading the plugin documentation is highly recommended.

## Plugin Creation
After knowing what plugins are provided here and how to use them, you can imagine that creating a plugin is easy.

### `Configure`
First thing you need is `Configure` function.
Just start to make it into your plugin and continue.

### Read Configuration
Because `Configure` function receive a Gowok project object, you can read configuration on that.

If you want to read configuration managed by Gowok, do it.
```go
project.Config
```

If you want to read raw configuration in `map[string]any`, do it.
```go
project.ConfigMap
```

After that, you can use that to making your plugin.
